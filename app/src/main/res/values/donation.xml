This app is and will always be <b>free</b> and with <b>no ads</b>.\n\n
I hope you enjoy it and will use it for finding many sondes and have lots of fun.\n\n
But. I cannot help thinking of other countries, where you are not free to wander through the country as we do chasing sondes.
Because of <b>landmines</b>. Because of <b>unexploded bombs</b>.
If you use this app I strongly encourage you to donate to help demining Cambodia.\n
And when you find a sonde take a minute to send some more.\n\n
Thank you\n\n
